In June of 2021, I moved to Berlin. My partner and I arrived in the city just as lockdown was lifted for the first time in over 6 months, just as the weather was warming and the city was leaving behind a solitary and difficult beginning to the year. Young people were finally getting vaccines, bars and restaurants were allowed to seat people outside with a minimum of fuss, everything was coming alive all at the same time.

We were moving from NYC, so from one big and bold city to another, but Berlin certainly felt different. I took a few days off work to get my bearings, then returned to my job as a software engineer at Artsy. I met with colleagues in the park, started making a few friends, walked around the city and marveled at how beautiful summer in Berlin was.

And then I stopped.

I stopped leaving the apartment after work to explore. I stopped cooking. I mostly stopped working.

Instead, I watched YouTube videos.

This wasn't a new habit for me—I'd been watching significant numbers of YouTube videos for years—but this time, I could feel how unhappy it was making me. I was in a new city, a new chapter of my life, and I was doing less than I ever had been before.

On July 5th, I wrote in my journal:

```
I'm still spending most of my free time watching YouTube videos. Probably a couple hours a day on average.

I guess this really goes deeper than I want to admit...I'm treating this like something I can just change easily, and then I'm disappointed or ashamed when I don't. But it's actually not going to be easy, it's deeply ingrained.
```

The next day, July 6:

```
Yesterday I again spent hours after work watching youTube - something like 8pm - 12am. This morning, I googled "youtube addiction" and read a few results. It helped me build a bit of momentum; I added blockers to Firefox both desktop and mobile, and I also downloaded my full YouTube watch history.
```

That day, I was inspired by [this blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-my-youtube-addiction-and-how-i-overcame-it-540c4893106), in which the author exported their YouTube watch history and visualized it. I decided to try doing the same. I'd been watching YouTube videos for over 10 years at this point, and I knew I had a problem.

But just how bad was it?
