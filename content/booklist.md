These are a few of the books that have changed how I think about the world. They're the ones I return to on a regular basis, loan out to friends, bring up in conversation.

- The Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le Guin
  - A socialist "utopia" means hard work, sacrifice, and less choiceâ€”but also means support, equality, camaraderie, and creativity.
- The Lilith's Brood trilogy by Octavia Butler
  - The human focus on hierarchy will be our inevitable downfall. Also plastic sucks.
- How We Show Up by Mia Birdsong
  - There are so many ways to live that are more fulfilling and bountiful than "nuclear family against the world." Community means asking for things, sharing, relying on each other.
- 4,000 Weeks by Oliver Burkemann
  - Stay on the fucking bus.
- Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat by Samin Nosrat
  - That's not nearly enough salt in the pasta water. No, seriously, keep going. Biiiiig pinch. C'mon now, don't skimp.
