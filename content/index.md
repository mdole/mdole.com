title: 👋🏻 Hi, I'm Matt
---
I'm a web developer, currently working at [Root](https://rootglobal.io) and formerly at [Artsy](https://artsy.net). I love inline skating, good sci-fi & fantasy, making food for friends, taking bike trips, interesting coffee, and dancing.

I'm based in Berlin, enjoying learning German, and always open to a friendly chat.
