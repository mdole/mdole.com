      The couch cushions are down-filled;
      <br />
      it's West Elm (used, purchased via Craigslist
      <br />
      from a guy in a swanky Dumbo apartment and
      <br />
      hauled up the four flights of stairs to our
      <br />
      apartment the day we moved in) and it must be
      <br />
      at least 3 fathoms deep, the kind of couch
      <br />
      that, once sunk into, must be climbed out of
      <br />
      one limb at a time. This morning,
      <br />
      the couch refuses to relinquish my body.
      <br />
      It has designs on my day.
      <br />
      I had plans to meditate, to journal, to jog,
      <br />
      but this morning, it will be me,
      <br />
      some toast, my phone,
      <br />
      and the couch.
