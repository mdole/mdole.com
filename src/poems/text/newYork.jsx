      i have never learned to write poems about new york
      <br />
      some people thrive in the big noise
      <br />
      i miss the cornfields of iowa and the lakes of minnesota
      <br />
      stars through treetops, crickets at dusk
      <br />
      the sirens do not sing to me here
      <br />
      the honking makes me miss hissing, aggressive geese
      <br />
      i have traded the smells of fresh-cut grass
      <br />
      and damp earth for hot piss and spilled trash
      <br />
      rats, roaches, and other megavarmints
      <br />
      but: where else do you eat like this?
      <br />
      where else do you walk like this?
      <br />
      where else do you talk with these people?
      <br />
      where else do you see yourself?
    </div>
