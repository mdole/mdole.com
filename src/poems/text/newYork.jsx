      I never learned to write poems about New York.
      <br />
      Some people thrive in the big noise.
      <br />
      I miss the cornfields of Iowa and the lakes of Minnesota,
      <br />
      stars through treetops, crickets at dusk.
      <br />
      The sirens do not sing to me here.
      <br />
      The honking makes me miss hissing geese.
      <br />
      I have traded the smells of fresh-cut grass
      <br />
      and damp earth for hot piss and spilled
      <br />
      trash, traded blue jays and robins for
      <br />
      rats, roaches, and other megavarmints
      <br />
      <br />
      But: where else do you eat like this?
      <br />
      Where else do you build these stories?
      <br />
      Where else do you see yourself?
    </div>
